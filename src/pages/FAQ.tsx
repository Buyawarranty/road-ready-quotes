New cars usually come with a manufacturer\'s warranty for about 3 years. After that, you\'re on your own unless you get an extended warranty. That\'s where we come in – giving you peace of mind and helping you avoid surprise bills.',

Our extended warranty helps protect you from unexpected costs – whether it\'s a breakdown, electrical fault or something else. We also include extras like roadside recovery, car hire and onward travel. It\'s all about making life easier and less stressful when things go wrong.'

Here\'s how it works:\n\n* If you\'re within your claim limit, and the parts and labour are covered by your plan, you won\'t have to pay anything.\n* You may need to pay any warranty excess, the cost of parts not covered by your plan, or any amount above your claim limit.\n\nThis way, you\'re always clear on what\'s covered and what (if anything) you\'ll need to pay.'

  {
    id: 'claim-limit-choice',
    question: 'What claim limit is right for me?',
    answer: "It depends on your vehicle and how much protection you want.\n\n£1,000 is ideal for smaller or lower‑cost repairs.\n£2,000 offers broader cover for most mid‑range repairs.\n£3,000 is our most popular option and covers the majority of common faults in full.\n£5,000 provides our highest level of protection and is best suited to newer, higher‑value or more complex vehicles where repair costs can be significantly higher.\n\nEvery plan includes unlimited claims, and you're covered up to the value of your vehicle, whichever limit you choose."
  },

    id: 'most-expensive-repair',

  },
  {
    id: 'how-make-claim',
    question: 'How do I make a claim?',
    answer: "Arrange for your vehicle to be inspected by a local independent repair garage to diagnose any issues. Once diagnosed, before any repairs are conducted, the repairer must directly contact our Claims Team at 0330 229 5045. It's important to note that failure to do so will not allow us to process your claim."
  },
  {
    id: 'how-much-cost',
    question: 'How much does it cost?',
    answer: 'Warranty costs start from just £12 per month, depending on your vehicle and the level of cover you choose. Get an instant quote by entering your registration number above.'

  },
  {
    id: '30-day-wait',
    question: 'Is there a 30‑day wait for new customers?',
    answer: "No - your cover begins immediately. As long as there are no pre‑existing faults on the vehicle, you're protected from the moment your warranty starts. The only things we can't cover are issues that were already present before the plan began."
